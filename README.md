# Purpose
This product will solve the issue of not waking up due to getting used to an alarm. Very often you will just have one alarm tone and after a long time your brain may get used to hearing it and so it will no longer surprise you or wake you up. This product will instead require more activity to snooze it and thus better waking the user. It will accomlish this by playing a loud noise from speakers that can only be turned off by furiosly shaking the product.

# Initial Design Plan
- The product will have at least one speaker but possibly more. 
- It will use the accelerometer to detect input from the user.
- Possibly a wifi connection, if that is possible.
- Code will include:
  - A function to check if the accelerometer has exceeded a preset threshold to turn off the speakers.
  - A function that determines what time it is based on either information from maybe WiFi or a preset internal clock, possibly a combination of both.
  - A function that plays a tone.
